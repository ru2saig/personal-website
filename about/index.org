Hello, there! I'm Nidhish, interested in robotics, embedded development, free software and anything else that beeps and boops. On this website you'll find posts about stuff I find interesting, in-progress projects, experiments and much more. For "finished" projects, check this [[https://ru2saig.github.io/projects/][page]].
